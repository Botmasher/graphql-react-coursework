# GraphQL and React Udemy

## Description

## Getting Started

The notes follow the videos. They are numbered and organized in this folder.

To get the "users" project running:
- open your shell
- navigate to `projects/users/`
- start the data serving on `3000`: `npm run json:server`
- start the node server: `npm run dev` (or `node server.js` for manual run)
- open a browser
- visit `http://localhost:4000/graphql`
- happy querying! (see the `schema.js` and `db.json` to know what's available)
